Swift-Course
============

A small demo of Swift for newcomers.

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Samuel Goodwin from Roundwall Software, Ash Furrow from Artsy and Marga Keuvelaar from Black Pixel will introduce you to iOS programming with Swift in the way programmers learn best: through hands-on practical exercises. By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the UI coding, connecting to network resources, and the Xcode IDE... and most important, the skeleton of your first application. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.
